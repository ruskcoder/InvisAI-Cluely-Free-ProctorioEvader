## How to Use
1. Launch InvisAI.exe
   - If Windows tells you "this app has been blocked", then press "More" and "Run Anyway"
2. Complete the warning notices. 
    - To work, Gemini needs to be signed in on one of your browsers, prefferebly Microsoft Edge. Your browser must also be closed when running the first AI Capture. 
    - Microsoft Copilot requires you to have a `.har` file saved to `har_and_cookies`. You can does this manually, or follow the instructions on the app to sign-in and automatically grab the `.har` file. 
    - To use Qwen and DeepSeek, Tesseract must be installed. 
3. Press **Start Capture** or press **S**
4. Left click on both your corners of the question. 
5. Wait for the AIs to complete and give you an answer!
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note: Qwen AI and DeepSeek AI don't have a direct image AI function, so InvisAI reads the text in the image and plugs in that. Because of this, these AIs don't support image/stimulus based questions.

## Known Bugs:
